Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use
the grading scheme we are using in this class.
#Get the input score from the user
score = int(input("Enter your score:"));

#Check the range within which the score falls into and print the respective grade
if score >= 90 and score <=100:
    print("Your Grade is A");
elif score >= 80 and score <=89:
    print("Your Grade is B");
elif score >= 70 and score <=79:
    print("Your Grade is C");
elif score >= 60 and score <=69:
    print("Your Grade is D");
else:
    print("Your Grade is F");
